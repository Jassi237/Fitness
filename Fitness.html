			<p>Sneak in a few exercises if you find yourself in the office with a quick break. Or multitask and do some exercises while doing a hair or face mask.Let these routines do the thinking for you, especially on days when your mind is fully occupied.Aim to do these routines for about 15 to 20 minutes a day, a few times per week. Allow for at least one full day’s rest in between sessions.</p> <br>
